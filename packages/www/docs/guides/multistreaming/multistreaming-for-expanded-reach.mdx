# Multistreaming for Expanded Reach

Livepeer.com multistreaming represents a straightforward way to meet users where
they are with live media playback on popular media sites or possibly on devices
its not practical to distribute your app on. In North America, some popular
supported media sites include Facebook Live, Twitch, and Youtube Live.

## Managing Multistream targets in the Livepeer.com Dashboard

The Livepeer.com Dashboard represents a convenient alternative way (vs the
Livepeer.com API) to explore Livepeer.com's multistreaming capabilities.

To add, manage, and delete Multistream Targets, navigate to the
[Dashboard Streams page](../../../dashboard/streams) and click on a stream name.
On the stream detail page, on the Overview tab, you can view all configured
targets. You must configure new Multistream Targets for each stream. This will
apply the multistream configuration to that stream. Multistream Targets do not
carry over when you create new streams.

To add a new target, select Create on the right side of the Multistream Targets
section. You'll be asked to name your target, provide the Ingest URL and a
stream key, being Ingest URL the only required value. The Ingest URL and stream
key should be provided by the platform that you're streaming into and can be of
the RTMP, RTMPS or SRT protocols. Select the rendition profile that you'd like
to send to that target and click Create Target. Once created, you can toggle the
targets on and off.

To edit a Mulitstream Target, click on the three dots to the right of the target
name and then on Edit to open up the target settings. Select Update target when
you've completed your changes.

To delete a multistream target, click on the three dots to the right of the
target name and then on Delete.

Note: Any changes to Mulitstream Targets, including creating new targets, will
apply only to the next active session. If you make changes while a stream is
active, those changes will not apply until the current session has ended and a
new session begins.
