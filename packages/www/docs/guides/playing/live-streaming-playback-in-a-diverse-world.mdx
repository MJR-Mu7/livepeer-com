# Live Streaming: Playback in a Diverse World

Every great contemporary app relies on standards and open source implementations
of those standards, media playback apps especially.

Livepeer.com playback is built upon one such foundational standard called
[HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)
and the media engine behind Livepeer.com has excellent and mature support for
it. Consequently, expect to see nearly complete contemporary device support
across web and native.

Additionally, Livepeer.com supports adaptive HLS and thus automatically does the
work required for end-user playback at a variety of bitrates and pixel
dimensions, especially lower bitrates and dimensions for mobile users.

Playback URLs for live and recorded media have the following form on
Liveper.com:

Live `https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playback id}/index.m3u8`

Recorded `https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/{stream id}/index.m3u8`

## Creating Paywall for Your Live Streams

Building paywall is a common approach for monetizing live video content. While
Livepeer.com does not have a built-in paywall feature, it integrates well with
other tools and platforms that do.

Example solutions include:

1. [JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/) allows you to create a password for
   each video asset, or to lock down access to public video altogether via URL
   token signing. Refer to the
   [JWPlayer Livepeer.com demo app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo)
   for an example integration between JWPlayer and Livepeer.com.
2. For WordPress sites, there is a
   [rich plugin ecosystem](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/paywall/) that
   provide many different paywall options.
3. You can use application logic to hide the unique Livepeer.com video playback
   URL behind a custom paywall by default.
