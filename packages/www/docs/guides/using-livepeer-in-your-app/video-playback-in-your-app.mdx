# Selecting a video player for your app

Livepeer.com doesn’t have it’s own player, but works with open source and 3rd party players. The Livepeer.com playback URL will be an M3U8 file, the basis for the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format. When selecting a player, pick one that supports HLS playback. 

Other considerations are if the player provides analytics out of the box and if you can easily style the player.

Some open source players enjoyed by current Livepeer.com users are [Video.js](https://videojs.com/) and [Shaka Player](https://opensource.google/projects/shaka-player).
