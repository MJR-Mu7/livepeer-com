# Clone a Livepeer.com example app

View on github: [github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-app)

This demo app showcases how to use the Livepeer.com API to create a live stream and then enables the user to play it back. It uses NextJS API routes to communicate with the Livepeer.com API. 

The demo app uses `POST /stream` endpoint to create a new stream. Read more in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/stream/post-stream).

You will need an API Key to use this application. This [documentation page](/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key) has instructions for acquiring a Livepeer.com API key.
