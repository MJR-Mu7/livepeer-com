# Live Streaming: How and What to Send to Livepeer

Like with playback, Livepeer.com supports the most widely adopted approaches for
sending media from an encoder. RTMP/RTMPS is the venerable standard for live
media ingest and widely supported among software and hardware media encoders.
RTMP/RTMPS URLs in Livepeer.com have the following form:

`rtmp://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream key}`
`rtmps://rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream key}`

SRT is an emerging live media ingest standard and where supported, there's
strong interoperability. Livepeer.com support for SRT is currently in Beta. SRT
URLs in Livepeer have the following form:

`srt://rtmp.livepeer.com:2935?streamid={stream key}`

RTMP and SRT also serve as the standards for Livepeer.com's multistreaming
functionality. See Related Topics below for multistreaming details.

## Software Encoders that Support Both RTMP and SRT
