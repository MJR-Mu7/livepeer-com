# Recording for Playback On Demand

<!-- Establishes that we do recording well and that recorded playback likewise allows
instant playback start and seek across the same wide range of devices as with
live. -->

With Livepeer.com, recording is a capability that can be enabled (default is
off) at the stream level, either via the API or via the Dashboard UI. In either
case, the recording setting applies to only new live sessions for that stream.

Default playback of recorded media uses the same HLS standard as live, thus
providing capabilities like fast startup, instant seek, and the same wide device
support as HLS live. On-demand HLS will be available for adaptive playback with
the same set of bitrates and dimensions as the live source was. The on-demand
download will be at the same bitrate and dimensions as the live source.

The structure of the playback URLs for Live, On-Demand, and Download are
contrasted below:

Live HLS `https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{Stream Key}/index.m3u8`

On-Demand HLS `https://cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/{Stream ID}/index.m3u8`

On-Demand Download
`https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/{Stream ID}/source.mp4`

Most media players support playback of all 3 forms above without special
configuration.
