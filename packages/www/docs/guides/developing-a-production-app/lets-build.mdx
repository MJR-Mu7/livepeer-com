# Let's Build!

Ready to begin implementing a media app using Livepeer.com? That's awesome!

Here are the prerequisites.

- A Livepeer.com Account

  Create one [here](https://livepeer.com/register).

- A Developer Key

  Provision one from
  [this link to the developer section of the Dashboard](https://livepeer.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys).

- The Ability to Encode Media and Connect to Livepeer.com via RTMP or SRT
  Protocols

From there, explore the other topics in this developer-centic portion of the
docs or go right to the [API Reference](../../api-reference) (always available
in the main navigation).
