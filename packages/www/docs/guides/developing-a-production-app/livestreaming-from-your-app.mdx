# Livestreaming from Your App

To support RTMP or SRT broadcasting from your native app running on devices with
cameras and mics, you can use any high-quality RTMP or SRT library/SDK. A small
set of examples includes:

- [Streamaxia OpenSDK](https://www.streamaxia.com/) for Android and iOS
- [Larix Broadcaster SDK](https://softvelum.com/larix/) for Android and iOS

Livepeer.com is currently working on additional recommendations for RTMP and SRT
libraries/SDKs. [Contact us](/contact) if you need a recommendation urgently.
