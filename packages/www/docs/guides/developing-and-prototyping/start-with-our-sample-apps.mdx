# Start from Source with Our Sample Apps

<!-- Describes and then links to Github source repos for a variety of apps that developers would borrow liberally and learn from. -->

<!-- This topic may be redundant with the content on the /docs/guides start page. -->

In addition to the
[source of the Livepeer.com Dashboard](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-com/tree/master/packages/www/pages/dashboard),
we've built and are sharing the complete source for the demos below as learning
tools for understanding how to build media apps with the Livepeer.com API.

## Livepeer.com demo web app

View on github:
[github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-app](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-app)

This demo app showcases how to use the Livepeer.com API to create a live stream
and then enables the user to play it back. It uses NextJS API routes to
communicate with the Livepeer.com API.

The demo app uses `POST /stream` endpoint to create a new stream. For additional
details about that endpoint, see its
[API reference](/docs/api-reference/stream/post-stream).

<!-- You will need an API Key to use this application. This
[documentation page](/docs/guides/start-live-streaming/api-key) has instructions
for acquiring a Livepeer.com API key. -->

## Livepeer.com demo web app with JWPlayer integration

View on github:
[https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo)

This demo app uses JW Player for playback, inserting a player via JW Player's
REST API. The JW Player is unique among HLS players with the sophistication of
its Quality of Experience analytics functionality.

## Livepeer.com react-native demo app

View on github:
[https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-react-native](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-demo-react-native)

This is an example mobile application for Android and iOS, built with
React-Native. It showcases how to send and playback Livepeer.com video directly
from a mobile app.
