# Selecting a Video Player for Your App

Livepeer.com supports playback via the
[HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming).
This standard has extremely wide support across web and native technologies
across a wide variety of devices used for media playback. See the table below
for details on Livepeer.com support for popular HLS player implementations.

Importantly, when you send your live video to Livepeer.com, we automatically do
the work required for end-user playback at a variety of bitrates and sizes,
especially lower bitrates and sizes for mobile users.
