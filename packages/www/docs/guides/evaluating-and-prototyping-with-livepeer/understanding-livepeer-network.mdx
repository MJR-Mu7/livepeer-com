# Understanding the Global, Always-On Livepeer Network

Livepeer leverages a readily available global network of always-on, incentivized
transcoding providers that eliminate server boot-up latency from the video
transcoding pipeline. Transcoding begins the moment a request hits our API, as
there are always transcoders waiting and ready to take on transcoding “jobs.”

Livepeer has discovered a new, underutilized source of transcoding capacity -
cryptocurrency mining equipment. There are thousands of “mining farms”
distributed all around the world, each equipped with thousands, or hundreds of
thousands, of GPUs typically used for cryptocurrency mining. Within every one of
these GPUs exists a video encoder card not currently being used.

Livepeer makes it possible for these data center operators to put their video
encoder cards to use and turn on a lucrative new revenue stream with no
additional cost or overhead. This new zero-cost revenue stream incentivizes
these data center operators, or as they are more colloquially called, miners, to
join the Livepeer transcoder network and provide excellent transcoding services
to those who request them.

Thanks to this distributed network of always-on transcoders, Livepeer can
transcode video segments much faster than realtime in just a few hundred
milliseconds. Intelligent segment distribution and redundancies across the
Livepeer network, in turn, ensure elegant fall back options in case of bad
transcoder performance. In short, transcoding never stops.
