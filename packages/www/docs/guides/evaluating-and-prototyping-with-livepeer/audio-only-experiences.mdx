# Audio-Only Experiences

With Livepeer, live audio-only experiences are as straightforward to implement
as audio-visual experiences.

Often the only change required is to append `?video=false` at the end of
playback URL to get an audio-only stream:

`https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8?video=false`

For many web-based HLS players, simple substituting an HTML `<audio>` tag for
the `video` tag and then CSS styling as appropriate is sufficient.
