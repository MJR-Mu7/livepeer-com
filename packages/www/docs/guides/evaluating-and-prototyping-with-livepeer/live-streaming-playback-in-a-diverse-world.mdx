# Live Streaming: Playback in a Diverse World

<!-- Establishes that we support HLS playback well, including the best HLS players/frameworks and that we're adaptive to a wide range of device displays and network speeds. -->

Every great contemporary app relies on standards and open source implementations of those standards, media playback apps especially.

Livepeer.com playback is built upon one such foundational standard called [HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) and the media engine behind Livepeer.com has excellent and mature support for it. Consequently, expect to see nearly complete contemporary device support across web and native.

Additionally, Livepeer.com supports adaptive HLS and thus automatically does the work required for end-user playback at a variety of bitrates and pixel dimensions, especially lower bitrates and dimensions for mobile users.

Playback URLs for live and recorded media have the following form on Liveper.com:

Live
`https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playback id}/index.m3u8`

Recorded
`https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/{stream id}/index.m3u8`
