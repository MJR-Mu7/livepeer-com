# Recording for Playback On Demand

With Livepeer.com, recording is a capability that can be enabled (default is
off) at the stream level, either via the API or via the Dashboard UI. In either
case, the recording setting applies to only new live sessions for that stream.

Default playback of recorded media uses the same HLS standard as live, thus
providing capabilities like fast startup, instant seek, and the same wide device
support as HLS live. On-demand HLS will be available for adaptive playback with
the same set of bitrates and dimensions as the live source was. The on-demand
download will be at the same bitrate and dimensions as the live source.

The structure of the playback URLs for Live, On-Demand, and Download are
contrasted below:

Live HLS `https://cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{Stream Key}/index.m3u8`

On-Demand HLS `https://cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/{Stream ID}/index.m3u8`

On-Demand Download
`https://mdw-cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/{Stream ID}/source.mp4`

Most media players support playback of all 3 forms above without special
configuration.

## Recording and Disconnects

Sometimes, after you’ve connected your encoder (for example, OBS) to a
Livepeer.com RTMP server, the connection drops. For example, this could happen
because of a bug in the encoder software or a problem with the streamer’s
internet connection.

Livepeer.com has a built-in 5 minute reconnect window, which means that if the
streamer’s encoder disconnects and then reconnects within 5 minutes, the session
will resume. When using the Livepeer.com recording feature, the recorded session
will**not**be split into two separate sessions.

The reconnect window is currently not customizable.
