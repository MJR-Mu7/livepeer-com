# Media Analytics: What Gets Measured and Aggregated

Great analytics are a vital part of any contemporary application that streams
media. This topic then discusses a variety of media analytics considerations
when building with Livepeer.com.

As a way to level-set, the types of analytics available from the Livepeer.com
service will be ones that help you measure what's often referred to as
[Quality of Service (QoS)](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=145718).
For measuring what's often called Quality of Experience (QOE), your custom
Livepeer.com-based application's own client-side analytics and the analytics
that you get from your chosen media player are currently your best source of end
user-level analytics (e.g. how many person-minutes of live playback did a
certain stream have).

## Getting Answers to Your Analytics-Based Questions

With that in mind, let's cover through examples, the types of analytics-based
questions that can be answered programmatically (i.e., through the Livepeer.com
API).

Examples:

### Count of All Active Media Streams

Want to assess the media-creation vitality of your creator community? It's
straightforward to programmatically sample an aggregate count of your creators'
active live streams.

### % of Sessions with a Given Health Status

Anticipating what you'd do upon getting reports of end users not able to
playback media at their expected quality or without playback stalls? It's really
straightforward to programmatically create an indicator that snapshots the
percentage of all of your Livepeer.com live streams that are in an unhealthy
state.

For additional background on the Stream Health API, see
[this developer-centric topic](../developing-a-production-app/stream-health-candidate).

### Total Transcoding Minutes in a Past Time Period

Here you might aggregate your total transcoding minutes in a given time period
as a high-level measure of how intensive is your own platform being used by
media creators. The Livepeer.com Dashboard app does just that (for the current
billing period) as seen in its Home > Usage section.

## Connecting Livepeer.com Analytics to Your Other Analytics

Connecting analytics systems requires shared identifiers/keys between those
systems. Below is discussion about the primary identifiers from the Livepeer.com
service and considerations for using them to connect analytics across
Livepeer.com (QoS), your chosen media player (QoE), and your custom app.

There are 2 primary Livepeer.com identifiers relevant to analytics, the Stream
ID and Playback ID.

As seen in
[this sample end-user app utilizing JW Player](https://github.com/livepeer/livepeer-jwplayer-demo/blob/main/pages/api/stream/index.ts#L120),
at the creation of every media stream, a Stream ID and Playback ID are returned
from the Livepeer.com API. It should be a straightforward exercise to
associate those 2 Livepeer Video identifiers with the JW Media player's
Analytics ID. Upon doing so, you now have a bridge between Livepeer's QoS analytics and your media player's QoE analytics. You're consequently able to answer powerful questions like: What Livepeer.com service
events are correlated to stalls in the media player?
