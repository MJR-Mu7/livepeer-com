# Real-Time Monitoring of Stream Health

Livepeer provides a number of methods for teams to do real-time monitoring of your app's use of the Livepeer.com service, including via the Dashboard UI, Logging, or a custom app/script using the Stream Health API.

## Types of Health Metrics

- **_Transcoding_** — A `Healthy` status indicates that video transcoding is
  occurring and the multiple profiles of your stream are available for playback.
  An `Unhealthy` status indicates that we have failed to generate the profiles
  so only the original video will be available. Check the event log (described below) for
  any actionable errors or check the
  [Livepeer.com Status page](https://livepeer.statuspage.io/) for platform-wide issues.

- **_Real-time —_** This indicates whether the Livepeer.com network is transcoding your source stream
  faster than real time, in other words, if the video transcode rate is lower
  than the video duration. An `Unhealthy` status here may be caused by unconventional
  configurations.

- **_Multistreaming —_** For multistream connections to destinations like YouTube, Facebook, etc, this health check indicates whether all configured
  `Multistream Targets` are connected.


## Global Health Status

Across all streams, here's how Livepeer aggregates health status:

- `Healthy` indicates that all of the Health Checks are in a `Healthy` state.
- `Unhealthy` indicates that one or more of the Health Checks are in an
  `Unhealthy` state
- `Idle` indicates that there are no currently active streams


## Logs

Logs will surface informational alerts (ex. stream has started/stopped,
multistream destinations have connected/disconnected) or any fatal errors from
the transcoding process. An example of a fatal error is:

```bash
Transcode error from ewr-prod-livepeer-orchestrator-0 for segment 0:
**Unsupported input pixel format**
```


## Session Ingest Rate

Session ingest rate tells you the bitrate of the video received by Livepeer
ingest servers, updated every 10 seconds. A high bitrate is suggestive that
streams into the Livepeer system are high quality, your encoder is working
properly, and your encoder network's internet connection is good. A fluctuating or low bitrate may
suggest that your encoder is configured improperly or that the encoder network's internet
connection isn't as strong as it should be to deliver high quality streams to
your viewers.

The Dashboard provides a graphical view into this metric on a per-stream basis.
