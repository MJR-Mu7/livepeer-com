# The Livepeer Dashboard: No Code

While Livepeer.com is a programmable platform, there's been considerable
investment in tools like the Dashboard app that present UIs that allow you to do
things like:

- Filter or sort all streams by status
- Manually provision streams and get stream keys and playback IDs
- See all of the renditions (i.e. adaptive bitrate and dimensions) of a stream
  for playback
- Check the health status of an individual stream
- View/download a recording of an individual stream
- Manually create a webhook
- Provision a new developer key

You might for example use the Livepeer Dashboard to assess a limited trial of
supporting 2160p live (aka 4K live).

Navigate directly to the Dashboard [via this link](../../../dashboard) or via
the top navigation of these pages.
