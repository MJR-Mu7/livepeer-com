# How to pick an RTMP ingest and playback URL pair

Your users or your application will need to use two Livepeer.com URLs, an RTMP ingest URL and a playback URL.

1. The RTMP ingest URL is for the broadcaster to ingest the video stream, for example `rtmp://{region}-rtmp.livepeer.com/live/{stream-key}`.
1. The playback URL is for the viewers to watch the stream, for example `https://{region}-cdn.livepeer.com/hls/{playbackId}/index.m3u8`.

An RTMP ingest and playback URL pair references hardware in different parts of the world. This is important because the ingest point should be as physically close to the broadcaster as possible. Each region is three letters, the airport code of the server location. 
**Use the ingest and playback URL pair in the region closest to your broadcaster.**

For any stream session, **you must use the RTMP ingest URL and playback URL pair from the same region.** Even though the playback URL references the ingest location, playback will work for your viewers everywhere.

Next, learn about the [specifications on the stream page](/docs/guides/dashboard/stream-page-specifications).
