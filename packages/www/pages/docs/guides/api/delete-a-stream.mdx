# How to delete a stream with the Livepeer.com API

<p>
  <font color="red">Deleting a stream cannot be undone.</font>
</p>

To delete a stream, youâ€™ll need the `id` (a.k.a. the stream ID) from when you
[created a stream object](/docs/guides/api/create-a-stream).

Delete the stream by sending a `DELETE` request to
`https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}`. For example:

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api-key}' \
-X DELETE "https://livepeer.com/api/stream/{id}"
```

When a stream is deleted, the stream object `name` is not reusable.
