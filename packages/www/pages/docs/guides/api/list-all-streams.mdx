# How to use the Livepeer.com API to list and filter streams

You can retrieve all `stream` objects with the same `userID`. The response will include both `stream` objects that represent a livestream configuration and stream objects that represent a single livestream session. The latter have a `parentId` set to its parent `stream` object's `id`.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream"
```

### Common examples

The following examples show decoded JSON object. But, remember that anything passed as a parametre in a GET request URL must be URL encoded. 

#### Exclude sessions

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?filters=[{"id": "parentId", "value": "???"}]"
```

#### Only return sessions with the same `parentId`

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?filters=[{"id": "parentId", "value": "1234abcd-1234-abcd-1234-abcd1234abcd"}]"
```

#### Return active streams and exclude sessions

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?filters=[{"id": "parentId", "value": "???"},{"id": "isActive", "value": "true"}]"
```

#### Retrun all idle streams and exclude session

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream?filters=[{"id": "parentId", "value": "???"},{"id": "isActive", "value": "false"}]"
```
