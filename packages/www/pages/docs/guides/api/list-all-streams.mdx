# How to use the Livepeer.com API to list and filter streams

You can retrieve all `stream` objects with the same `userID`. The response will include both `stream` objects that represent a livestream configuration and stream objects that represent a single livestream session. The latter have a `parentId` set to its parent `stream` object's `id`.

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer {api_key}' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream"
```

### Common examples

The following examples show decoded JSON object. But, remember that anything passed as a parametre in a GET request URL must be URL encoded. 

#### Exclude sessions

You can retrieve all `stream` objects with the same `userID` but exclude stream
objects _with_ a `parentId`. This fi

```bash
curl -H 'authorization: Bearer <api-key>' \
"https://livepeer.com/api/stream/user/<userId>?streamsonly=1"
```

#### Only return sessions with the same `parentId`

#### Only return sessions with the same  `parentId` with recording on

#### Return active streams

#### Retun all idle streams
