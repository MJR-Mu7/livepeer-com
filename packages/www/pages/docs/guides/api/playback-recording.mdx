# How to playback a recorded session

A livestream session recording is available approximately 5 minutes after the livestream session has ended. When the recording is ready, the session `stream` object `recordingStatus` value will change from `waiting` to `ready`.  

> ⚠️ You will need to poll this endpoint to get the updated `recordingStatus` value. In the future, we will support webhooks.

Once the recording is ready, the the session `stream` object's `recordingUrl` parameteter will return the .m3u8 recording playback URL. 

The recording playback URL will look something like this: `https://region-cdn.livepeer.com/recordings/<id-of-stream-session>/index.m3u8`. View the live stream with any HLS video player.

Next, learn [how to list all streams created by a user with the Livepeer.com API](/docs/guides/api/list-all-streams).
