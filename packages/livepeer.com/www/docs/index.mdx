## Livepeer API Documentation

Livepeer supports live streaming, video on demand, and transcoding across video
formats and protocols. The Livepeer API provides a secure, straightforward way
to transcode video using Livepeer infrastructure. Please note that the Livepeer
API product is under heavy development with new features added regularly.

# API Endpoints

`https://livepeer.com/api/stream`

- `POST /stream` - create a stream (Protected by `Bearer` API key auth)
- `GET /stream/:id` - getting streams by ID (Protected by `Bearer` API key
  auth)

`https://livepeer.com/api/broadcaster`

- `GET /api/broadcaster` a list of broadcasters

`{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

- `POST https://{broadcaster_url}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts` MPEG-TS
  segment ingest point after getting the broadcaster URL (using `POST`)
- This endpoint also works for `.mp4` files.  We recommend sending `.mp4` files that are **less than 120 seconds**.

# API Tutorial

In this tutorial you will transcode one source `.ts` segment into three renditions 
for playback. By the end of this tutorial, you will have an understanding of the
basic Livepeer API calls and expected responses. And from there, you can start
integrating your own platform with Livepeer's live transcoding service. Let's
begin!

**Step 1:** Create a "stream" with the transcoding profiles you want by sending
POST to `/stream` with `name` and `profiles`. For example:

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
-d '{
  "name": "test_stream",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "1080p",
      "bitrate": 6000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1920,
      "height": 1080
    },
    {
      "name": "720p",
      "bitrate": 2000000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "name": "360p",
      "bitrate": 500000,
      "fps": 30,
      "width": 640,
      "height": 360
    }
  ]
}' \
https://livepeer.com/api/stream
```

You will get back a `json` response that includes an `id` field. This represents the ID of the stream. You will need this later.

**Step 2:** Request a list of Livepeer broadcasters address from `/broadcaster.`
For example:

```shell
curl https://livepeer.com/api/broadcaster \
  -H "authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
```

You will get back a list of `json` objects that represent a list of broadcaster addresses. Pick any of the broadcaster addresses to send the source `.ts` segment.

**Step 3:** Now it's time to POST your .ts segment. to
`{broadcaster_address}/live/{stream_id}/{media_number}.ts`

Set `Accept: multipart/mixed` headers. A continuous livestream should start with
the `media_number` set to `1`.ts and count upward to `2`.ts, `3`.ts and so on
for each segment.

Here is an example using the broadcaster address `https://test-broadcast-url.live`.
You'll need to replace that URL a broadcaster address from Step 2.

```shell
curl -i -X POST https://test-broadcast-url.live/live/<stream_id>/1.ts \
  -H "Accept: multipart/mixed" \
  --data-binary "@source_segment.ts" > multipart
```

Note: If there is ever a problem uploading a segment, make a new request for a
list of broadcasters and POST to a different broadcaster address. You can still 
expect the stream to be at the same URL.

**Step 4:** The `multipart` file contains 3 different segments. 

When you integrate your own video platform with Livepeer, your platform should
split the response into 3 different video segments based on the text delimiter,
and insert them into a HLS playlist for playback. 

The content of the file looks something like:
```
--27bee784e2f2672487f5
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="1080p_101.ts"
Content-Length: 459284
Content-Type: video/MP2T
Rendition-Name: 1080p
...Data
--27bee784e2f2672487f5
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="720p_101.ts"
Content-Length: 459284
Content-Type: video/MP2T
Rendition-Name: 720p
...Data
--27bee784e2f2672487f5
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="360p_101.ts"
Content-Length: 459284
Content-Type: video/MP2T
Rendition-Name: 360p
```
_note: if the `multipart` file looks different, most likely there was an issue with your request.  Please visit our [support channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/98g8Dqn), or email support@livepeer.org._

You can use [`munpack`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/munpack) to unpack the multipart file. For example:
```
munpack multipart
```
You should see:
```
1080p_3.ts.2 (video/mp2t)
720p_3.ts.3 (video/mp2t)
360p_3.ts.4 (video/mp2t)
```
_note: To install `munpack`, use `brew install mpack` for macos, and `apt install mpack` for Linux._

You should be able to play the separate `.ts` files using any video player.  For example, `ffplay 1080p_3.ts`

# Live Streaming API

You can send an RTMP video stream to the Livepeer API and get the transcoded 
HLS video stream. You can serve the transcoded outputs through a CDN or save them 
for future use.

Livepeer is currently testing this feature with select beta users. If you would
like to use this today, email [sales@livepeer.com](mailto:sales@livepeer.com?subject=[Beta%20request]%20RTMP%20API).
