This repo is the home of the following projects and libraries:

* ### [@livepeer/chroma](./@livepeer/chroma)

  > A component library that contains some UI building blocks for livestreaming video applications.

* ### [@livepeer/explorer](./@livepeer/explorer)

* ### [@livepeer/graphql-sdk](./@livepeer/graphql-sdk)

  > A GraphQL API that can be used to simplify protocol exploration. Currently, it exposes queries for getting a job by id or a list of jobs filtered by broadcaster address and/or whether it is currently "live". Can be used directly in the browser or in node.js applications.

  > A command line protocol explorer. It has a console mode that allows you to interactively use the sdk.

* ### [@livepeer/player](./@livepeer/player)

  > A video player for the web. Lets you see what's live streaming on the network. Our hosted media player ([media.livepeer.org](https://media.livepeer.org)) runs off of this project.
